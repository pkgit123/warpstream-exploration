# WarpStream Exploration

This folder contains resources and code examples for learning about WarpStream, a cloud-native streaming platform that Cursor uses for real-time data processing.

## What is WarpStream?

WarpStream is a cloud-native streaming platform designed to be a drop-in replacement for Apache Kafka, offering:

- **Kafka-compatible API**: Works with existing Kafka clients and tools
- **Cloud-native architecture**: Built for modern cloud environments
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-per-use pricing model
- **High performance**: Optimized for real-time streaming workloads
- **Managed service**: No infrastructure management required

## Learning Path

1. **Start with basics**: Understand streaming platforms and Kafka concepts
2. **Compare with Kafka**: Since WarpStream is Kafka-compatible, learn Kafka first
3. **Try the API**: Use the examples in this folder
4. **Build a streaming app**: Create a simple producer/consumer application
5. **Explore advanced features**: Stream processing, connectors, etc.

## Key Differences from Apache Kafka

- **Pricing model**: Pay-per-use vs. infrastructure costs
- **Deployment**: Managed service vs. self-hosted
- **Scalability**: Automatic scaling vs. manual cluster management
- **Integration**: Cloud-native integrations vs. traditional infrastructure
- **API compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for Kafka clients
